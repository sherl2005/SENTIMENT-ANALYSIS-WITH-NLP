# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-WITH-NLP

## Company Details

- **Company**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  
- **Name**: SHERLIN MARY N  
- **Intern ID**: CT08NKX  
- **Domain**: MACHINE LEARNING & NLP  
- **Duration**: 4 WEEKS  
- **Mentor**: NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR  

## Description

This repository contains the implementation of **Sentiment Analysis** using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Logistic Regression** in **Google Colab** as part of my internship at **CodTech IT Solutions**. The goal of this project was to classify text data into positive or negative sentiments.

### Key Features:
- **Dataset Used**: Customer Reviews Dataset
- **Libraries Used**: `Scikit-learn`, `NLTK`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Tokenization and Stopword Removal using `NLTK`
  - TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets
- **Model Training**:
  - Implemented **Logistic Regression** classifier
  - Tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix visualization

## Output

Below are some visualizations from the implementation:

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-nlp.git
   ```
2. Open the `Sentiment_Analysis_Using_TF_IDF_and_Logistic_Regression.ipynb` in **Google Colab**.
3. Run all the cells sequentially to execute the sentiment analysis model.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn
```

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience with **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The use of **TF-IDF** and **Logistic Regression** demonstrated an effective way to classify sentiments. Future improvements could involve experimenting with **deep learning models** like **LSTMs** or **BERT** for enhanced accuracy.
